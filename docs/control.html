        <h2>Control is not properly exercised in modern psychiatric diagnosis and treatments</h2>
        <div>
            <b>disclaimer</b> The following scrutiny is my subjective assesment on current psychiatric diagnosis in the world. None of the following is either a medical advice or supposed to have any medical value. I am by no means a medical expert, let alone specialized in psychiatry. I am a computer engineer with
my certain cognitive biases which definitly affect my assesments. I am writing this speculation to hear what other people think on this matter.

Over the recent years, I began to contemplate the influence of life events on my depression and eventually came to the impression that my depression was likely <b>caused by</b> a chemical imbalance in my brain, which could potentially be remedied through a neuropharmaceutical intervention or a traumatic brain injury resulting from a car accident. At times, I even entertained the idea of being hit by a car in order to reset my brain circuits and mental traits. Consequently, throughout my twenties (2015-2022), I engaged in a process of experimentation with various psychiatric medications, some of which were prescribed by my psychotherapist and others that I initiated out of personal curiosity. During this period, I have been on and off the following drugs:

In 2015, I began my journey into the fascinating world of psychiatry. At the time, I was suffering from chronic depression and had forgotten what it felt like to be happy. Feeling isolated, a close friend referred me to a psychotherapist. This was the first time I had ever consulted an expert in psychology/psychiatry. Over the following months, we began to practice dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) and eventually my therapist prescribed me 50mg of Sertraline.
</p>
<p>
In 2016, after a year of taking medication, I felt an overall improvement in my mental health, particularly in that I was no longer suicidal. Although I cannot accurately describe the specific changes that occurred, I generally felt better. <b>This raised the question of whether this subjective improvement was due to the medication, talk therapy, life events such as travelling more, or simply getting older and wiser. Alternatively, it could be a combination of all these factors.</b>
</p>
<p>
The question of what factors led to this subjective improvement is an important one, as it can inform whether or not medications should be continued, given their potential side effects. Additionally, knowing which factor was the most influential can allow for more effective planning to take advantage of it. (Also my pre-existing curious personality and graduate studies have enabled me to develop a researcher's mindset, which has instilled in me an urge to identify the root cause of my observations.). 
</p>
<p>
In 2017, I discontinued the use of SSRIs. Subsequently, in 2018, I relocated to Canada to pursue a graduate degree. From 2018 to 2020, despite the stress of immigration and starting anew in a foreign country without any familiar faces, I would say I didn't suffer form chronic depression. 

</p>
<p>
In 2020, I graduated and got my current job (offices closed at that time due to Covid) as well as moving out and renting a large unit for myself. However, when Fall 2020 arrived, everything began to collapse. The summer in Vancouver ended and the long-lasting rain, foggy and cloudy weather of Vancouver set in. I recall that in 2018 there was not a single day of sun for an entire month; when it finally did appear, it became the headline of the local newspaper. Over the years, I have noticed that
I am particularly sensitive to sunlight and am highly prone to seasonal depression. Despite being perceived as highly successful by others (A note to people optimizing for success), I felt lonely, depressed and hopeless during Fall 2020. <b>This led me to question whether living with a roommate and attending classes and labs with other people had a significant impact on my mental health from 2018 to 2020; now that these are no longer part of my life, I have started to experience
    chronic.</b>
</p>
<p>
After careful consideration, I decided to resume taking antidepressant medication. In the past, I had taken an interest in researching and comparing different antidepressants, and I had particularly read many <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1niiV8I4cgk_xZ1Blou15ImPmqXU4eb_li9eRVp5NgYo/mobilebasic">positive reviews</a> about Bupropion. It is known to be effective in treating seasonal depression and providing mood stabilization. This was a very encouraging discovery.
</p>
<p>
At the time, I did not have a family doctor, so I visited a walk-in clinic and described my symptoms of depression, as well as my history of taking SSRIs. The doctor prescribed me Sertraline, but I asked if it would be possible to try Bupropion instead. He agreed, and I was excited to have the opportunity to experiment with this different class of antidepressant drug known as SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). On the first day of taking Bupropion, I felt very active and
energetic; however, this was likely due to a placebo effect. Over the following days, the effects of the placebo wore off and I returned to feeling normal. After one week of taking Bupropion, however, I began to experience too much anxiety and eventually decided that it was best for me to discontinue use.
</p>
<p>
Over the subsequent months, I dated a girl, and I also felt an overall improvement in my mental state. However, I was left with a lingering query: <b>Was this improvement due to the relationship, the return of sunlight during Springtime, or some other factor?</b>
</p>
<p>
We broke up in Summer. I started to feel aweful and depressed. I feel like the reason for the depression was not the break up itself, it was just an ignition for whatever that has been under the ashes. In the summer of 2021, I visited a psychiatrist for depression and was prescribed both SSRI and a non-stimulant psychoactive for ADHD. The psychiatrist noted that I exhibited many symptoms of ADHD, such as perfectionism and obsession, talking very fast, and frequently interrupting others while speaking. This diagnosis made sense to me as my friends know that I am a highly novelty-seeking person with a high potential for addiction which are all highly associated with ADD/ADHD. Interestingly, no formal ADHD test was conducted. Upon receiving this diagnosis, I was excited to experiment with this new class of psychiatric drug in order to verify if I have ADD/ADHD. This could potentially explain my depression as ADD/ADHD is highly associated with it. However, when I asked the psychiatrist how it is possible that I have ADD/ADHD but have never had any issues with my studies or work, he replied that if properly diagnosed, I may have won a Nobel Prize.
</p>
<p>
Upon beginning a course of medication, I watched the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2948372/">Soul</a>, which had a profound effect on me. This prompted me to focus more on learning how to appreciate the small moments in life. To this end, I began daily meditation, set a goal of ceasing work at 5 pm each day, and developed a daily ritual. Additionally, I read several papers on gratitude journaling and began to practice it myself. After approximately one month of this regimen, I felt
great and for the first time in my life did not consider myself a pessimist. And again the same question. <b>This improvement was due to the medication, meditation, gratitude journaling or something else? Which one? </b>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this feeling was short-lived as seasonal depression or some other form of depression returned when fall arrived. In December 2021, I began dating a girl and recently celebrated our one-year anniversary. During this past year, I have been feeling much better, and attribute a large portion of this to being in a committed relationship and having a supportive partner. During Spring and Summer 2022, I noticed an increase in addictive behaviors and impulsive decisions. I felt like my need for stimulation was not being met, and began to entertain the notion that I suffer from ADHD. Further, I believed that my unsuccessful trial of Atomoxetine was due to it not being an actual stimulant, but rather requiring a stimulant medication to be effective.
</p>
<p>
In order to pursue further examination of the possibility of ADHD, I visited another psychiatrist and requested a formal test. However, the questionnaire administered was not especially reliable in my opinion. For instance, the question of ‘how often do you do X’ was answered using a scale ranging from ‘never’ to ‘very often’, yet the answer I would give heavily depends on the situation. At times, my answer would be ‘never’ while other scenarios might require me to reply ‘very often’, making it difficult to definitively answer such questions. To resolve this issue, I simply settled on an average response of ‘sometimes’. The doctor then concluded that I had achieved a score at the border of ADD, rather than ADHD. While this does not confirm that my problems stem directly from ADD, it does signify that I had achieved a score that indicated I may experience the same accompanying symptoms.
</p>
<p>
The commencement of my exploration into psychiatric stimulants, such as Ritalin, marked the initial steps of a journey that I had hoped would enable me not to suffer when waiting for elevators, as well as ceasing to engage in rumination or searching for high stimulant activities. I was pleased to have access to such stimulants. My psychiatrist further suggested I may also wish to try Trintellix, a new SSRI with a different mechanism of action, in order to combat anxiety and depression. With no
current feelings of depression, I decided to proceed with the experimentation, all the while being worried that I may, in some way, be harming my brain with these "experiments". My psychiatrist calmly reassured me that nobody knows this for sure, as he too had experimented with various chemicals over the years.

In October, I underwent a lifestyle change in which I ceased activities such as smoking and watching pornography. Although I appreciated the health-related benefits of this decision, further research into the psychological and neurological ramifications of addiction prompted a further impetus for quitting. Specifically, studies have demonstrated that addictive behaviors, including those as seemingly innocuous as pornography consumption, can result in <a
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      href="https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/relevant-research-and-articles-about-the-studies/hypofrontality/">Hypofrontality</a>
which <a href="https://www.yourbrainonporn.com/tools-for-change-recovery-from-porn-addiction/rebooting-basics-start-here/unwiring-rewiring-your-brain-sensitization-and-hypofrontality/">heavily contributes to impulsive behavior</a>. Taken aback by such revelations, I questioned whether my personal addictions had been impacting my overall wellbeing. My decision to abstain from these activities, reinforced by such knowledge, has provided several notable results over the past two months. I have found myself feeling better in general, engaging in activities that I would previously procrastinate, and desiring high stimulant activities to a lesser extent. This has allowed me to invest more time in productive endeavors.

<p>
Any yet the same question still bothers me: Where are these improvements coming from? Possible answers:

<ol>
    <li> It's temporary or random. </li>
    <li> It's the SSRI kicking in after 2 months. </li>
    <li> It's Ritalin kicking in after 2 months. </li>
    <li> It's due to quitting porn and fixing the hypofrontality. </li>
    <li> It's due to quitting smoking contributing to improvement in hypofrontality. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>

If it's not feasible to control potentially impactful variables being added, the best solution I can think of is something like backward elimination. Within classical machine learning, it is important to determine whether a given feature is useful for training say a logistic regression model. One approach for accomplishing this is backward elimination, which involves removing a feature and then assessing the effect on model performance. This could be analogous to ceasing an ongoing medication
and monitoring oneself for a specified period of time in order to assess any changes. It is paramount to actively monitor changing variables while avoiding the discontinuation of other existing medications. 
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, both the doctor and patient should take greater caution when assessing and drawing conclusions, as well as controlling for variables. In fact, this task can be particularly difficult, as many variables may not be easily monitored by the patient. Nonetheless, clinicians should be more vocal about it; this was not the case with my previous doctors and I often found myself questioning whether any improvements were due to medication or any other aspects of my lifestyle.
