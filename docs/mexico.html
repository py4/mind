    <h1> Hitchhiking in Mexico </h1>
    
    <h3> Intro </h3>
    <p>
    After <a href="#">my recent hitchhike</a> from the west of Canada (Vancouver) to the east of Canada (Montreal), I truly felt that I should repeat the same experience again, this time in another country.
    <br>
    Lately I've been very busy with my research and submitting a paper to a conference. So I'm very tired expectedly.
    If I stay in Vancouver for Chrismass holidays, I'm definitly going to waste it and nothing can refresh me like a new adventure. What's better than a hitch trip in a new country?
    <br>
    Mexico is awesome for this sake. I've not been exposed to sun in the recent 21 days, but Mexico is sunny  and it's better to escape from Vancouver specially these days. <br>
    So I've planned to hitch through Mexico.
