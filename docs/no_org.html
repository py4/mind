            Apparently I have a fetish toward minimalism. I have had multiple blogs before. I started with wordpress and then self-hostem wordpress. Then turned to static-site generator. Now I'm looking for something more radical. Anything with theme does not satisfy me. Anything fancy does not satisfy me. I'm looking for something radical Completly different. I think It's like Porn. My receptors are getting used to the theme of my prevous blog. My last resort is to write raw HTML
            without any theme. When I read hackernews, the more radical the link's theme is, the more I feel getting orgasmed. I don't know why I'm like this but at the moment I'm writing this I'm satisfied.
