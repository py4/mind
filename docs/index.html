            I have a fetish for minimalism. I've owned multiple Wordpress blogs before. The last one was a truly minimal one to write my own monologs. Later on I turned to static-site generators because I felt a server/database is overkill for hosting a simple blog. I tried both <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> for my blogs. I'm <a href="http://py4.ir/blog">currently happy with hugo</a>. However, recently I felt an urge toward more extremism in the wonderland of minimalism: Minimizing visual beauty and CSS modifications. Consequently I created this
            page to practice this new radicalism.

        - I attended <a href="https://neurips.cc">NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver</A> from Dec 10th to 14h. It was my second attendance in a big conference. My first one was <a href="https://www.emnlp-ijcnlp2019.org">EMNLP 2019 in Hong Kong</a>. A big part of it for me was meeting a couple of my old friends whom I had not seen for a couple of years. Attending a conference is fun. I guess the most important part of attending a conference is talking to many interesting people. Otherwise, papers and talks (depends) are available online. Some NLP
        related materials I liked:
